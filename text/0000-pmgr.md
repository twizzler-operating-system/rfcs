# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC introduces the pager system. The
purpose of the pager is to have a mechanism to allow for an object to exist outside the kernel's knowledge (e.g. on an
SSD or out on the network) and for that object to be brought into memory when needed. The kernel interacts with the
pager by submitting page and object info requests on a shared queue. Userspace programs also interact with the pager,
submitting sync commands to control how object memory persists, and what order pages are written to stable storage.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

This mechanism is vital to support any amount of persistence or sharing, as we need some established
mechanism for the kernel to defer to userspace in the case that an object doesn't exist in memory
but does elsewhere. This also directly supports persistent objects, and combines directly with the
runtime and transaction support. We expect the result to be, 1) a stable API for the kernel to defer to
userspace, 2) a system-level userspace service that handles those requests and can interact with
storage devices to load objects into memory (and sync them back to storage), and 3) a stable API for
other applications to submit requests to the pager (not included in this RFC).

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

The *pager* provides 4 primary functions:

1. Managing memory pages provided by the kernel.
2. Filling those pages as needed to handle object page fetching commands from the kernel.
3. Ensuring persistence for modified pages according to restrictions set by userspace (e.g. on flush ordering).
4. Maintaining a cache of object memory pages, evicting as needed.

```

The pager service is tightly coupled with the kernel, as it responds to any requests from the kernel to fetch
object pages from disk. On startup, the kernel establishes a shared queue over which it can send requests, and then
gives ownership of (likely, a majority of) free DRAM to the pager so that it can manage it as necessary. Once the kernel
starts its paging services, it will always forward page faults that it cannot immediately handle (ones that require allocating
a new page, or reading a page from stable storage) to the pager.

Applications, too, use a shared queue to communicate with the pager, established on application startup. These requests allow
applications to flush pages to stable storage, as well as discard, zero, and copy them.

Internally, the pager maintains a cache of object data pages along with an eviction strategy. When evicting an object page,
the pager requests the kernel to unmap that page. If the page is dirty, the pager must then write out the modified page to stable
storage, but _not_ in-place, i.e. the pager will never flush a page to stable storage object data unless explicitly told to.

## Setup

The kernel expects the init program to communicate to it a pair of object IDs that are each Queue
objects---the *kernel request queue*, and the *pager request queue*. These objects allow for
communication between the kernel and userspace, where the userspace portion is expected to be a
binary program started by init that handles kernel paging requests.

This coordination on which objects to use for queues is done via the kernel using the `sys_new_handle` system call. The
init program calls this function twice to record first the kernel request queue, and second the pager request queue.
Once these queues' IDs are both told to the kernel, the kernel starts its internal paging mechanisms (implementation details not
outlined in this RFC).

## Kernel-Pager Queue Types

The kernel pager request queue's submission and completion types are:

```{rust}
enum KernelToPagerRequest {
    /// Provide ObjectInfo in response
    ObjectInfoReq(ObjID),
    /// Provide PageInfo in response
    PageDataReq(ObjID, [ObjectRange; NR_RANGES]),
    /// The kernel is giving ownership of these ranges to the pager
    DramPages([PhysRange; NR_PHYS_RANGES]),
}

enum KernelToPagerCompletion {
    Success,
    ObjectInfo(ObjectInfo),
    /// These should match the ObjectRanges from the request in structure.
    PageInfo([PhysRange; NR_RANGES]),
    Err(KernelToPagerReqError),
}

struct ObjectRange {
    start: u64,
    len: u64,
}
```

The pager's request queue has the following types:

```{rust}
enum PagerToKernelRequest {
    Evict(ObjID, [ObjectRange; NR_RANGES], EvictFlags),
    ObjectCopy(CopyCmd),
    Prefetch(ObjID, ObjectRange, PhysRange),
    ObjectInfo(ObjectInfo),
}

enum PagerToKernelCompletion {
    Success,
    EvictSuccess(EvictStats),
    Err(PagerToKernelReqError),
}

struct CopyCmd {
    src: ObjID,
    dst: ObjID,
    len: usize,
    src_start: usize,
    dst_start: usize,
}
```

The pager can directly submit information about pages and objects to the kernel before the kernel
even asks for it, allowing for prefetching (possibly in the background, or application-driven). The
kernel can choose to ignore these prefetching requests.

## Pager-User Queue Types
An application's pager request queue's submission and completion types are:

```{rust}
enum UserToPagerRequest {
    /// Provide ObjectInfo in response
    ObjectInfoReq(ObjID),
    /// Prefetch page data
    Prefetch(ObjID, [ObjectRange; NR_RANGES]),
    /// Sync modified pages
    Sync([SyncCmd; NR_SYNC_CMDS]),
    /// Discard modified pages
    Discard(ObjID, [ObjectRange; NR_RANGES]),
    /// Forget that pages are modified
    ForgetWrites(ObjID, [ObjectRange; NR_RANGES]),
    /// Copy object data
    ObjectCopy(CopyCmd),
}

enum UserToPagerCompletion {
    Success,
    ObjectInfo(ObjectInfo),
    Err(UserToPagerReqError),
}

struct SyncCmd {
    id: ObjID,
    ranges: [ObjectRange; NR_SYNC_RANGES],
}
```

## Memory Management

The kernel provides free DRAM to the pager on startup, transferring ownership of most of physical memory
to the pager. When transferring object data, the pager typically will not need to access the contents of any
given data page, instead submitting DMA requests with the address. However, it may occasionally need to read
physical pages, for example, when reading on-disk storage metadata. The pager can simply create a new object
the standard way and then back that object's data pages with any physical pages the pager needs to read.

The pager will track all DRAM pages that it owns, along with flags for dirty, accessed, mapped, and shared.
These bits are provided to the pager in two ways: as a bitmap from the kernel per memory region, and upon
successful eviction request from the pager (EvictSuccess variant in PagerToKernelCompletion). The bitmap
is written to by the kernel, and read by the pager. The pager can use the information in this bitmap to influence
eviction policy. After successful eviction from the kernel, the returned bits are used to determine current
status (to avoid time-of-check to time-of-use errors). 

### Physical Ranges

When communicating lists of pages back and forth, both sides use an array of `PhysRange`. A `PhysRange` defines
a contiguous physical memory region, made up of unused DRAM. At the end of the physical memory region, the kernel
provides a metadata region, containing a bitmap of flags per page in the region. This metadata region is located at
the end of the physical memory region to allow for maximum physical memory alignment at the start of the region (may
be important for DMA).

The `PhysRange` struct looks like: 

```{rust}
struct PhysRange {
    start: u64,
    nr_pages: u64,
    meta_nr_pages: u32,
    _flags: u32,
}
```

The `_flags` field is unused, and reserved to 0. The `meta_nr_pages` field defines the number of pages that the metadata for
this page range takes up.

### Eviction

If the pager runs out of managed memory pages, it will need to evict existing pages. This RFC does not detail the eviction strategy
nor the cache implementation. However, regardless of strategy, when a page is evicted the pager will not write the data back to disk
in-place, instead it will write to a swap area to as to avoid forcing a sync of object data. To assist in eviction strategy planning,
the bitmap per memory region provided by the kernel provides flags that can be used to affect a cost analysis of evicting a given page.

### Pinning Pager Memory

It is vital that the pager itself, (1) never swap out its own pages, and (2) ensure that any memory allocated to the pager is fully backed.
For (1), we can just track which objects the pager needs and disallow eviction for them, and for (2) the pager can use the Prefetch PagerToKernel request
to ensure any objects (like the heap) have backing memory pages.

## Kernel Requests

Above, we defined the request types. Here we'll elaborate on what they do.

### Object Info

When the kernel doesn't have knowledge of an object at all, the kernel asks the pager to provide initial knowledge via the ObjectInfo struct:

```{rust}
struct ObjectInfo {
    id: ObjID,
    lifetime: Lifetime,
    backing: BackingType,
}
```

This struct will likely grow over time.

### Object Page Data

When the kernel requests information about a page, it sends a set of `ObjectRange` structs for a given object ID. The
pager responds with a set of `PhysRange` structs. The pager's response does not need to fulfill the entire request, as
long as at least one page is filled (probably the first one). The kernel reads out physical pages, in order as specified
by the completion, and maps them in sequence into the object's page tree.

### Prefetching

The pager can prefetch pages as it sees fit, without informing the kernel. Since it owns DRAM, it can fill it with anything from
stable storage that it likes. It can then inform the kernel that these pages could be used via the Prefetch command. It can similarly
pre-inform the kernel about objects that the pager knows about but the kernel does not.

The user can issue prefetch requests to the pager (which may go ignored).

## User Requests

Requests from user programs differ from kernel requests, since they are communicating for different reasons.

### Sync

The primary command userspace will send the pager is a sync command, which itself contains an object ID and a set of object ranges
to sync. These memory regions are then written back to stable storage in-place (unlike eviction, which does not write in-place).

### Barriers

In addition to the UserToPager enum that gets sent with every request, the pager also recieves a set of flags, which specify barrier rules.
For now, we'll implement this as two flags: one prevents previous requests from reoredering with this one (release semantics) and one prevents
future requests from reordering with this one. We disallow reoredering requests that set either of these bits with other requests that set either bit.
If both bits are set, this request acts as a full barrier.

### Discard

User programs may also discard dirty pages (e.g. when aborting a transaction). The pager evicts and replaces the dirty page with a fresh one. If, however,
the user program can easily return the contents to their unmodified state, discarding the pages is unneccessary. Thus user programs can also send a ForgetWrites
command that acts similarly to discard, but it just asserts to the pager that the page has returned to an unmodified state. This request is dangerous, as it can
lose writes, so should be used with care. It is not safe to issue ForgetWrites if concurrent updates to a given page are possible.

### Copy and Zeroing

When copying large amounts of object data, user programs can issue an ObjectCopy command. This command copies (or uses copy-on-write) to copy data from one object
to another at byte granularity. The pager is responsible for maintainting copy commands and their effects across power cycles.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Ultimately, the system needs a manager of stable storage and a mechanism to move object memory
safely to and from that storage.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

This RFC makes a few strong design decisions. First is to fit the entire paging system in userspace, allowing
for userspace drivers, reducing kernel boundary crossings. Besides the performance benefits, we also make it
possible for userspace to interact with a rich persistence mechanism that can adapt over time more easily than
a kernel interface can.

Second, ownership of DRAM is given up to the pager, and the kernel is left with a limited amount of DRAM for its
internal use. The benefit is kernel simplicity -- we can put the complex caching and eviction logic for object
pages in userspace, and we can remove much of the complexity of the page-fault path from the kernel, especially compared
with a kernel that (1) knows about persistence, and (2) manages all object pages itself.

Another major component of this is the idea that a user application could submit syncing requests to
the pager in a more fine-grained way than "sync(2)" or "sync this object". The hope is to give
enough control to a transaction manager that could then efficiently sync only the pages that it
needs to to ensure failure-atomicity.

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

This approach is similar to standard microkernel designs where the functionality of paging and
drivers for stable storage cannot be added to the kernel. In the case of Mach, for instance,
the pager also sits in userspace and has tight control over memory. By contrast, however, this
RFC's approach enables more fine-grained persistence and more information about page status to be
shared between kernel and pager with lower overhead and fewer messages.

## Non-volatile Memory (NVM)

While NVM[^1] is not required for this system, it can be used as an accelerator for persistent
operations. The kernel can offer this memory to the pager in the same way as all other physical memory,
with perhaps a flag set to indicate that it is persistent. The pager can then use this memory for accelerated
persistence, e.g., by writing pages there on flush and moving them to an (e.g.) SSD in the background, or on eviction
from NVM.

[^1]: Here, we're specifically talking about NVM that sits on the memory bus. Other forms that can
    be accessed (e.g.) via NVMe are treated more like an SSD.
