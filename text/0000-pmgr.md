- Feature Name: paging_and_persistence
- Start Date: 2022-06-03

# Summary
[summary]: #summary

This RFC introduces the pager system, and specifies the core interaction between the pager system
and the kernel, and the interaction between the pager and userspace. The purpose of the pager is to
have a mechanism to allow for an object to exist outside the kernel's knowledge (e.g. on an SSD or out
on the network) and for that object to be brought into memory when needed. The kernel interacts with
the pager by submitting page and object info requests on a shared queue, and other applications may
interact with the pager via queues as well (to, e.g., submit synchronization requests or prefetching
hints).

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

This mechanism is vital to support any amount of persistence or sharing, as we need some established
mechanism for the kernel to defer to userspace in the case that an object doesn't exist in memory
but does elsewhere. This also directly supports persistent objects, and combines directly with the
twizzler-nando crate. We expect the result to be, 1) a stable API for the kernel to defer to
userspace, 2) a system-level userspace service that handles those requests and can interact with
storage devices to load objects into memory (and sync them back to storage), and 3) a stable API for
other applications to submit requests to the pager.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the system and you were teaching it to another Twizzler programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Twizzler programmers should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Twizzler. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Twizzler programmers and new Twizzler programmers.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other operating systems and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about
the lessons from other systems, provide readers of your RFC with a
fuller picture.  If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas
are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an
adaptation from other operating systems.

Note that while precedent set by other operating systems is some
motivation, it does not on its own motivate an RFC.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal
would be and how it would affect the operating system and project as a
whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more
fully consider all possible interactions with the project and system
in your proposal.  Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap
for the project and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
